<h3>Instructions</h3>

To clone, install and run this project, follow these steps: 

    git clone https://github.com/Ph3n0m3n0n/pirate-portal.git

then install the Node modules with

    npm install

then make sure MongoDB is running with

    mongod

from your MongoDB directory, and then run the code with
