<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>Handlebars</li>

</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

To clone, install and run this project, follow these steps: 

    git clone https://github.com/Ph3n0m3n0n/Guestbook.git

then install the Node modules with

    npm install

then make sure MongoDB is running with

    mongod

from your MongoDB directory, and then run the code with 

    node server

I finally got the

bug fixed. The app is not perfect yet but I will be perfecting it over time.
